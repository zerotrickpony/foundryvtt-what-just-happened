# foundryvtt-what-just-happened

This module turns on smooth scrolling in the chat log, and highlights recent batches of chat events, so that it's more clear what just happened. This is useful for visually following the results of macros that drop multiple messages into the log.

The highlight behavior, including border, title, color, and duration, can be configured by the GM for all players.

To release:
cd ~/.../src
zip ~/tmp/what-just-happened.zip *
